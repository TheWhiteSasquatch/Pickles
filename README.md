# 🥒 PICKLE PATROL - Watch Live Streams Like a Pickle Sheriff!

## 🚨 FIRST THING: This Is NOT About Real Pickles!

**IMPORTANT: This is NOT a pickle finder app!** 🥒❌

This is just a fun app that looks like pickles and watches live video streams on Kick.com. The pickle theme is just for fun - it has NOTHING to do with:
- Finding pickle stores
- Making pickles
- Eating pickles
- Pickle delivery

It's just cute pickle graphics for watching live streams! Think of it as a "pickle sheriff" who watches over your favorite streamers.

## 🐛 HAVING TROUBLE? (PICKLE PROBLEMS)

### Can't See the Pickle Logo?
- **Make sure Tampermonkey is turned on** in your browser extensions
- **Check the script is enabled** in Tampermonkey (it should be green)
- **Refresh the page** - sometimes that helps
- **Try a different website** - some sites block browser extensions

### Videos Won't Load?
- **Click the pickle logo first** - it needs to be "activated" to start checking
- **Check if the streamer is actually live** on Kick.com directly
- **Wait a few minutes** - it checks every 5 minutes for new streams

### Videos Look Weird?
- **Some websites block videos** for security reasons (like news sites)
- **You'll see a warning message** if this happens
- **Click the link provided** to open the stream in a new tab
- **This is normal** - the website is just being extra safe

### Chat Too Wide/Narrow?
- **Use the Chat Width setting** in the pickle settings
- **Make it thinner (200px)** to hide annoying pinned messages
- **Make it wider (500px)** if you want to see more chat
- **Changes happen instantly** when you adjust the slider

### Sound Not Working?
- **Some websites don't allow sounds** for security
- **Check your browser sound settings**
- **Turn sound on/off** in the pickle settings

### Running Slow?
- **The pickle is designed to be gentle** on your computer
- **Only checks when you're using it**
- **Try longer check intervals** in settings (like 5 minutes instead of 1 minute)

### Which Browsers Work?
- ✅ **Chrome** (version 80 or newer)
- ✅ **Firefox** (version 75 or newer)
- ✅ **Edge** (version 80 or newer)
- ✅ **Safari** (version 13 or newer)

### Things This Pickle Can't Do:
- **Can't control video volume** directly (browser security rules)
- **Can't take screenshots** without extra browser addons
- **Some work networks** might block it
- **Some websites are extra strict** and won't show videos
- **Can't remove pinned messages** from chat, but you can make chat thinner to hide them
- **Sound might not work** on some websites (they block auto-play sounds)

## 🔒 IS THIS SAFE? (PRIVACY INFO)

**Yes, very safe!** This pickle doesn't collect or send your personal information:

- **No Data Collection**: Only watches public streams that anyone can see
- **Local Only**: Your settings stay on your computer
