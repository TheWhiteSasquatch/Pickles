# 🥒 PICKLE PATROL - Custom Interface for Kick Streams!

## 🚨 FIRST THING: This Is NOT About Real Pickles!

**IMPORTANT: This is NOT a pickle finder app!** 🥒❌

This is a **browser extension script** that gives Kick.com a complete interface makeover! Instead of Kick's normal layout, you get a custom pickle-themed control panel with enhanced features. The pickle theme is just for fun - it has NOTHING to do with:
- Finding pickle stores
- Making pickles
- Eating pickles
- Pickle delivery

Think of it as a "pickle sheriff" who completely transforms how you watch Kick streams!

## 🎯 WHAT DOES THIS PICKLE DO?

### **🚨 Interface Makeover Alert!**
**This isn't just "watching Kick streams" - it completely transforms how you experience Kick.com!** Instead of using Kick's normal interface, you get a custom pickle-themed overlay with superpowers.

### **⚠️ Website Compatibility Warning**
**Not all websites work!** Some sites block browser extensions entirely. The pickle works best on:

- **🔄 Auto-Check**: Every 5 minutes, it checks if your favorite channels are live
- **🌐 Cross-Site Compatible**: Works on most websites (auto-starts within 30min of last use, otherwise click logo)

### Pickle Style Stuff:

### Extra Cool Features:

## 🐛 HAVING TROUBLE? (PICKLE PROBLEMS)

### Can't See the Pickle Logo?
- **Make sure Tampermonkey is turned on** in your browser extensions
- **Check the script is enabled** in Tampermonkey (it should be green)
- **Refresh the page** - sometimes that helps
- **Try a different website** - some sites block browser extensions

### Videos Won't Load?
- **Click the pickle logo first** - it needs to be "activated" to start checking
- **Check if the streamer is actually live** on Kick.com directly
- **Wait a few minutes** - it checks every 5 minutes for new streams

### Videos Look Weird?
- **Some websites block videos** for security reasons (like news sites)
- **You'll see a warning message** if this happens
- **Click the link provided** to open the stream in a new tab
- **This is normal** - the website is just being extra safe


### Sound Not Working?
- **Some websites don't allow sounds** for security
- **Check your browser sound settings**
- **Turn sound on/off** in the pickle settings

### Running Slow?
- **The pickle is designed to be gentle** on your computer
- **Only checks when you're using it**
- **Try longer check intervals** in settings (like 5 minutes instead of 1 minute)

### Which Browsers Work?
- ✅ **Chrome** (version 80 or newer)
- ✅ **Firefox** (version 75 or newer)
- ✅ **Edge** (version 80 or newer)
- ✅ **Safari** (version 13 or newer)

### Things This Pickle Can't Do:

- **Some websites are extra strict** and won't show videos

- **Sound might not work** on some websites (they block auto-play sounds)
